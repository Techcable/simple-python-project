# Techcable's python project template
Used for my python projects because python packaging is super complicated.

Sets up a basic project using setuptools + [setuptools\_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm).

It currently uses tox for environment management.

Forked from https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject
